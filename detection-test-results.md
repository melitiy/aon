# Shape Detection Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-01-14

### Test Setup
- Local server running on http://localhost:8000
- Testing with 4x4 grid puzzle images from /test/4/
- Templates loading successfully (using file-based templates via HTTP)

## Test Results

### Image 1 (/test/4/1.png)
**Expected shapes:**
- Row 1: Triangle, Cross, Empty, Empty
- Row 2: Cross, Square, Question Mark, Triangle  
- Row 3: Square, Circle, Triangle, Cross
- Row 4: Circle, Triangle, Empty, Empty

**Detection results:**
- Detected 11 shapes (console log)
- Grid displayed: Mix of triangles (▲), crosses (+), and circles (●)
- **Missing:** Squares were not detected at all
- **Issue:** Incorrect grid mapping - shapes not in correct positions

### Image 2 (/test/4/2.png)
**Expected shapes:**
- Row 1: Empty, Empty, Cross, Empty
- Row 2: Empty, Empty, Question Mark, Empty
- Row 3: Cross, Triangle, Empty, Square
- Row 4: Empty, Empty, Triangle, Empty

**Detection results:**
- Detected 7 shapes (console log)
- Grid displayed: 2 crosses (+), 2 triangles (▲), 1 square (■)
- **Better:** Square was detected this time
- **Issue:** Still incorrect grid mapping positions

## Identified Issues

### 1. Memory Management Error
- **Error:** "Mat instance already deleted" (BindingError)
- **Location:** processUploadedImage function
- **Impact:** Causes error dialog after detection, but detection still partially works
- **Cause:** OpenCV Mat objects being deleted prematurely or used after deletion

### 2. Inconsistent Shape Detection
- **Squares:** Not consistently detected (missed in image 1, found in image 2)
- **Detection count:** Detecting shapes but not all visible shapes
- **Possible causes:**
  - Template matching threshold too high (65%)
  - Template quality/size mismatch
  - Color variations affecting grayscale conversion

### 3. Grid Mapping Issues  
- **Problem:** Detected shapes are not placed in correct grid positions
- **Symptom:** Shapes appear randomly placed rather than in their actual positions
- **Likely cause:** Grid mapping algorithm not correctly calculating cell positions from detection coordinates

### 4. Missing Shapes
- **Stars:** Not detected (though may not be present in test images)
- **Empty cells:** Not properly identified as empty
- **Question marks:** Treated as shapes rather than unknowns

## Detection Statistics
- Image 1: 11 detections (should be ~10 actual shapes)
- Image 2: 7 detections (should be ~5 actual shapes)
- Success rate: ~50-70% for shape detection
- Position accuracy: ~0% (shapes not in correct grid positions)

## Next Steps
1. Fix memory management issue with OpenCV Mats
2. Improve grid mapping algorithm
3. Adjust detection thresholds
4. Test with different template scales
5. Add better logging for debugging grid mapping
